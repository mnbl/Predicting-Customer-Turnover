# Predicting Customer Turnover Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict customer turnover (churn) using machine learning techniques, particularly analyzing key features that may lead to customers leaving. By leveraging historical customer data, the project aims to help companies identify and reduce customer churn.

## Project Overview

- **Customer Turnover Prediction**: Analyzes factors contributing to customers leaving a company or service.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Provides actionable insights for businesses to reduce churn.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Preprocesses and visualizes the dataset.
- **Model Training**: Trains machine learning models on customer data to predict churn.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's performance with accuracy, precision, and other metrics.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mnbl/Predicting-Employee-Turnover
   cd Predicting-Employee-Turnover
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Project

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Run the notebook file `Loblaws.ipynb`, which includes steps for:
   - Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
   - Training the machine learning models.
   - Evaluating the models using different metrics.

## Dataset

The project uses a customer dataset:
- `loblaws.xlsx`: Contains historical data of customers used to train and test the model.
